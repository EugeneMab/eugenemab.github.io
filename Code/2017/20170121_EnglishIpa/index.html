<h1 style="text-align: center">English [&eacute;nglish&#601;] - English IPA Spelling Pronunciation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
	<div>
	For centuries, there has been a movement to reform the spelling of English.
	It seeks to change English spelling so that it is more consistent, matches pronunciation better.
	(Refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform#References" target="_new">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform#References</a>)
	However, the spelling reform has rarely attracted widespread public support due to various reasons.
	</div>
	<div>
	So, I propose an idea to solve the problem by another way around.
	Instead of changing the spelling to fit the pronunciation, we may <b>change the pronunciation to fit the spelling</b>.
	(Refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation" target="_new">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation</a>)
	</div>
	<div>
	The idea is to give a fixed pronunciation for each of the 26 letters.
	The most straightforward way is to assign the exact same IPA to each letter.
	(Refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" target="_new">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet</a>).
	The stress is fixed at one position, and a simple choice is always at the first vowel.
	For the consonant clusters which are hard to pronounce, we add an optional schwa [&#x0259;] to make them easy to pronounce,
	but the schwa should not change the stress position.
	</div>
<h2>Rules</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Every character is always pronounced as the International Phonetic Alphabet of itself.</li>
		<li>The stress is always located at the first vowel.</li>
		<li>Add an optional schwa [&#x0259;] to break consonant clusters, but the schwa should not change the stress position.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Spelling and pronunciation is always consistent.</li>
		<li>Need not to republish any English publications.</li>
		<li>Need not to relearn, because everyone knows the spelling can change his/her pronunciation accordingly.</li>
		<li>Can be used with the existing pronunciation, as a new English dialect.</li>
		<li>It may be more close to the ancient English pronunciation.</li>
	</ul>

		It is recommended to pronounce as defined by IPA.
		But some sounds are quite hard for English speakers,
		we define alternative sounds which are not conflicting with the existing sounds and easier for English speaker to pick up.

Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”
But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them.
Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.
Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
